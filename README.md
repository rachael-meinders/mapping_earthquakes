# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview
I have been tasked with transforming geoJSON data into neat, interactive maps to display data regarding earthquakes across the globe over the pas seven days.


## Purpose
This HTML page is intented to neatly display a collected dataset of earthquakes and their characteristics, as well as tectonic plates around the globe. The map is interactive in that you can change map styles, as well as choose which map layers you would like to display.
Branches within this repository store practice files, kept for future training and reference. These branches include a simple map, mapping single + multiple points, and geoJSON points + polygons + linestrings.

## Results
Interactivity is made possible by the layers options on the right, which takes user choice on map style, as well as selection of map layers.
